			<p>Here's a splendid pic! The boy enjoying his vacation,loving the warmth of the sun rays, making his cheeks flush,
			eyes eager and happy. However, the mother is squinting in the glare of the sun, trying to hide behind her son's

				The trip to Echchur...away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a great feeling, combined with the 
				bonus Asirvadam from the Echchur Perumal! Hope the Utsavar stays Happy :)
				PS: Note that Vedanth is almost as tall as his mom! Is he tall, or is she short? I leave it up to you to deicde ;)

				The good old days! It must have been a lot of fun...I know there are times when we wish everything could go back
				to how it was then. I wish I could have gotten to know the four of you as kids, fought and played with you. But all
				the same, there are good memories and stories shared across the genrations :)

				note: This project was a learning experience for me in front-end web designing, specifically with javascript.
				It was <u>not meant for anything else :p</u> other than that! The amazing book feature has been included thanks
