			<p>Here's a splendid pic! The boy enjoying his vacation,loving the warmth of the sun rays, making his cheeks flush,

				The trip to Echchur...away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a great feeling, combined with the 
				bonus Asirvadam from the Echchur Perumal! Hope the Utsavar stays Happy :)
				PS: Note that Vedanth is almost as tall as his mom! Is he tall, or is she short? I leave it up to you to deicde ;)

				The good old days! It must have been a lot of fun...I know there are times when we wish everything could go back
				to how it was then. I wish I could have gotten to know the four of you as kids, fought and played with you. But all
				the same, there are good memories and stories shared across the genrations :)

				note: This project was a learning experience for me in front-end web designing, specifically with javascript.
				It was <u>not meant for anything else :p</u> other than that! The amazing book feature has been included thanks
